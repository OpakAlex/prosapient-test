# ElixirTest
Run local:
 * `mix deps.get`
 * `mix test`

Tasks:
  1) List composition: `mix test test/elixir_test_test.exs`
     File with code: `lib/elixir_test.ex`
  2) File: `lib/elixir_test.ex`
  3) Api wrapper: `mix test test/git_hub_test.exs`
     File with code: `lib/git_hub.ex`
  4) It's so hard question, because Elixir it's a functional language, and i come from OOP (ruby). For me it's not like `problems` it's another think, i change my mind for write functional code.
What is better in Ruby on Rails? For me, it's Active Record, Ecto is good too, but elixir focuses on another cases, not just on REST API part. Rails it's just so greate REST API framework, this why AR great gem.
